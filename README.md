# Word-Ladder-I
Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, such that:  
  1. Only one letter can be changed at a time. 
  2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that beginWord is not a transformed word. 

For example,  Given: beginWord = "hit" endWord = "cog" wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"] 
As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog", 
return its length 5.
